      <h1>Pathfind.r</h1>
      <p>Pathfindr is a free, lightweight web application that generates a user-friendly, templated layout to simplify group trip planning. Pathfindr will allow its users to create, edit, and share detailed travel itineraries for improved group coordination. Its core features will allow exported itineraries such as ICS calendar files and PDFs. I chose this project to pursue, because I am an avid group traveler and often create itineraries for my family to follow along. The project itself will challenge my experience (or lack thereof) by incorporating back-end and front-end design, applying my cloud stack development education, and manipulating databases using various programming languages.</p>
